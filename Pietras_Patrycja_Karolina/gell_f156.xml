               very seldom seen. Next morning the <rs type="person" ref="XXX">General</rs> lent us horses. Mine was a strong black
               called John Bull. We rode to a wickerwork fort &amp; found <rs type="person"
                  ref="XXX">Ld. Wellington</rs>. He seeing me without uniform took me entirely under
               his protection &amp; walked me away from the company. Shewed me <rs type="person"
                  ref="XXX">Junot</rs>s Camp in the distance. Asked me what They said in England of
               the army. I said we were told we should meet it coming back half way over the bay of
                  <rs type="place" ref="XXX">Biscay</rs>. He quickly said “Then why did you come. I
               said because it was said you meant to fight &amp; I was sure if you did you would
               conquer. He was quite pleased at this. It was at the time <rs type="person" ref="XXX"

                  William Cobbett (1763-1835) was regularly scathing about Wellington in his Weekly
                  Political Register. The retrospective tone suggests that this passage was written
                  some time afterwards, as do the altered hand and the space left to remember the
                  horses's name.</note>. He said that he could stand the french if they came with no
               more than 100000 men &amp; that they could not provision more possibly. That it was
               said <rs type="person" ref="XXX">Buonaparte</rs> was coming. He would rather have
               10000 men more against him as <rs type="person" ref="XXX">Bonaparte</rs> could
               sacrifice the 10000 without a word being said against him. He wished the french would
               attack him but he could not attack them without being certain of Victory &amp; little
               loss, because not only he but the whole government at home would be destroyed by the
               least false step whereas <rs type="person" ref="XXX">Buonaparte</rs> feared no

               to a certain bridge in the valley below – When there said he look about you &amp; see
               how many guns are pointed at you. Tis only over that the enemy can come &amp; I wish
